<h2>Setup &amp; Configuration</h2>
<p class="push_top push_quarter">There's not a lot to set up, but if you're unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.lesscss.org" target="_blank">LessCSS</a> you may be a bit lost.</p>

<h4 class="push_top">Configuration</h4>
<p class="push_top push_quarter">Flatstrap comes with a robust configuration file full of lovely variables for you to tweak to get your website just right.</p>
<p class="push_top push_quarter">We've done this so you don't have to make crazy edits to the CSS behind Flatstrap's core to get your website perfect.</p>

<h4 class="push_top">Setting up LESS</h4>
<p class="push_top push_quarter">All the CSS within Flatstrap's core is pulled in through the base.less file, however your website will never read this LESS code. Instead we run the LESS compiler to turn all our lovely LESS into CSS, for more information on how to do this please visit <a href="http://www.lesscss.org" target="_blank">the LessCSS website</a>. If you're running a Mac I suggest using <a href="http://wearekiss.com/simpless" target="_blank">Simpless</a> by the awesome guys at <a href="http://wearekiss.com/" target="_blank">WeAreKiss</a>.</p>

<h4 class="push_top">Compilation</h4>
<p class="push_top push_quarter">So you've made a change to your websites config? Or some of Flatstrap's core? Awesome! Now all you have to do is compile base.less. That's all! All the other LESS files are loaded in through the base less file, so there's no need to compile them too! (They'll be dragged into your final CSS file).</p>
